# 714. Saga Cards

## 714.1

Each Saga card has a striated text box containing a number of chapter symbols. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the right side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.

- a. Saga enchantments that also have the type creature are printed with both a power and toughness box and an additional text box below the type line. Any abilities in that text box are independent of its chapter symbols.

## 714.2

A chapter symbol is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability referred to as a chapter ability.

- a. A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as “{rN}.” The numeral I represents 1, II represents 2, III represents 3, and so on.
- b. “{rN}—[Effect]” means “When one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].”
- c. “{rN1}, {rN2}—[Effect]” means the same as “{rN1}—[Effect]” and “{rN2}—[Effect].”
- d. A Saga’s final chapter number is the greatest value among chapter abilities it has. If a Saga somehow has no chapter abilities, its final chapter number is 0.
- e. A Saga’s final chapter ability is the chapter ability which has its final chapter number in its chapter symbol.

## 714.3

Sagas use lore counters to track their progress.

- a. As a Saga without the read ahead ability enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it. As a Saga with the read ahead ability enters the battlefield, its controller chooses a number from one to that Saga’s final chapter number. That Saga enters the battlefield with the chosen number of lore counters on it. (See rule 702.155, “Read Ahead.”)
- b. As a player’s precombat main phase begins, that player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control with one or more chapter abilities. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.

## 714.4

If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent with one or more chapter abilities is greater than or equal to its final chapter number, and it isn’t the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Saga’s controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesn’t use the stack.
